He explained that while severe lung scarring can be a precursor to cancer, there has been no direct causal link seen between SARS/#coronavirus and lung cancer."

However, he added that these ""squashed"" lung problems should decrease, as #COVID19 progression is being halted sooner now with steroid treatment."

At the same time, other patients are showing lung scarring 6 months after their initial #coronavirus infection."
1326975251859779585,2020-11-12 19:48:48+00:00,"Commenting on how patients suffering #LongCovid can have normal follow-up scans, Dr Hare told #RCRTalks delegates it appeared that many patients who had seemingly mild symptoms initially are feeling unwell for longer, with no obvious issues seen via lung #imaging...."

#RCRTalks"

1326968789368512517,2020-11-12 19:23:07+00:00,"Dr Hare wrapped up his #RCRTalks session by urging all patients in need to access the #NHS: ""we've put an infrastructure in place where we have non-#COVID19 sites and you can rest assured you will be safe when you come to hospital.""

#RCRTalks"
1326963425046646787,2020-11-12 19:01:48+00:00,"Dr Hare explained how #radiology teams have adapted practice ‚Äì using one scanner for non-#COVID19 patients and one for those with suspected/confirmed #coronavirus, utilising dedicated covid-secure sites and overnight reporting of possible covid cases. 
#RCRTalks"
1326962671506386944,2020-11-12 18:58:49+00:00,"Dr Hare noted how the #radiology community and @BSTImaging quickly worked to produce resources to help standardise #COVID19 chest X-ray reports, along with an open access database so chest radiologists could share expertise with colleagues across the UK.

1326961640198246401,2020-11-12 18:54:43+00:00,"Commenting again on the importance of #radiology, Dr Hare stressed: ‚Äúevery single patient was having an #imaging test for their #coronavirus, that is the untold story of the pandemic ‚Äì the oil that was driving the machinery of the hospital was the imaging department.‚Äù
#RCRTalks"
1326961118884007937,2020-11-12 18:52:39+00:00,"Dr Hare showed how life has changed for #imaging teams ‚Äì with full PPE for radiographers and radiologists making work more difficult, and radiographers doing more scanning with portable equipment to help with #COVID19 infection control.

1326960770542919681,2020-11-12 18:51:16+00:00,"Dr Hare stressed how #imaging has been vital for making a quick #COVID19 diagnosis to help hospital triage, given swabs can take 24-48hrs, with up to 1/3 false negatives.
#RCRTalks"
1326960359379513344,2020-11-12 18:49:38+00:00,"Dr Hare described how the flood of patients during the first wave of #coronavirus meant that the #NHS ‚Äúmetaphorically couldn‚Äôt breathe"", adding: ‚Äúordinarily I might see 1 or 2 patients with pneumonia during my normal day‚Ä¶ during the first surge I was seeing 40-50.""

1326959445767753731,2020-11-12 18:46:00+00:00,"Despite a negative #COVID19 swab, the patient clearly had an abnormal chest scan.

Dr Hare immediately told colleagues, ‚Äúignore the swab result, this is #coronavirus‚Äù, urging them to isolate the patient and instigate full infection control measures..."
